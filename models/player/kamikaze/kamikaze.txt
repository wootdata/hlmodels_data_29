Kamikaze Robot

2d art: [BMA]Mist
3d art: Obi Wan

This is basically a red and black skin for the obi01(Robot) model.

This is my second skin. Finished february 20, 1999.

In your SIERRA\Half-life\valve\models\player folder create a new folder called kamikaze.
In this folder then put kamikaze.mdl and kamikaze.bmp.

Other skins by [BMA]Mist:
Spider-Man
