"Grith" Half Life Model by Hydroman

Grith is an intergalactic hero travelling from planet to planet to help the ones in need
...you all know the type. I don't have time to come up with a better story, and I know you
wouldn't care even if I did.

Info:

Model by Hydroman.
My second model, the polycount is a bit on the high side, and it got some problems on the
hands, I don't know why this is, its not like this in 3dsmax. It's a 100% original model
and designed by my self.

Skins by Hydroman
Not much to say here.

A bunch of animations makes the arms go through the armor.
