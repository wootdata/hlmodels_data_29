Known bugs:
The joints at the top of the legs could do with modifying,
The "fire 2 handed" animation is terrible, but I don't think it is used in the game anyway.

Description:
These are my first ever half life models based on the robots in 'Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace' (Copyright Lucasfilm Ltd, used without permission). The model has a fairly high polygon count due to the rigid joints. This colour changeable model has a lower resolution head texture than version 1.0, so some people may prefer the original.

Installation:

Model Files:    Put Bdroid_c.mdl and Bdroid_c.bmp int valve/models/player/Bdroid_c.

Extras:

Team Logo:      Put Bdroid_c_logo.bmp in your logos directory.
Windows Cursor: Put Bdroid_busy.ani in your windows/cursors directory and set it up as the busy cursor (instead of the hourglass ).
